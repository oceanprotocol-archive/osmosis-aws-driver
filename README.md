## Setup

To use Amazon S3 storage with Brizo, you must set up some Amazon S3 storage and set some AWS configuration settings on the computer where Brizo is running. For details, see:

- [the README.md file in the Brizo repository](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/brizo/blob/develop/README.md) and
- [the tutorial about how to set up Amazon S3 storage for use with Ocean Protocol](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/amazon-s3-for-brizo/)

## Code Style

Information about our Python code style is documented in the [python-developer-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-developer-guide.md)
and the [python-style-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-style-guide.md).

## Testing

Automatic tests are setup via Travis, executing `tox`.
Our tests use the pytest framework.

## New Version

The `bumpversion.sh` script helps to bump the project version. You can execute the script using as first argument {major|minor|patch} to bump accordingly the version.
